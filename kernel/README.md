# kernel config

Build a custom linux kernel for Linode Linux VPS (on the remote destination machine).

Tested with Debian GNU/Linux 9.6 (stretch) + 4.20.3 (current stable).


to do: continue to turn things off until something breaks.


### hardening

The config was aided by the use of this tool: https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check


```
git clone https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check.git
```
